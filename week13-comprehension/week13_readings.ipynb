We already learned about decorators in class this week and delved into what they are, when to use them, the non-syntactic sugar equivalent and some commonly used decorators. Below, we'll focus on comprehensions. Even though this is technically a continuation of the syntactic sugar series, comprehension is a broad topic that derserves a separate discussion."

    "The first thing to note is that generator comprehension is written inside round brackets. The advantage of this over a list comprehension is that generators don’t create a single, large data structure in memory, but instead return an iterable(like we have seen with generator functions). We can fetch the values one by one from this iterable until there are no more elements to consume, which means we are storing a single value at a time. Calculating values only when explicitly requested is sometimes referred to as **lazy evaluation**. In the above example, when the generator yields a value, it is added to the current sum and discarded. The same cycle repeats when the generator yields the next value. Note that we don't require an explicit `for` loop here to iterate over the generator values as `sum()` is also an iterable function that iterates over the numbers given to it for summing."

    "It is clear that comprehensions are faster compared to their `for` loop equivalents. Let us quickly also understand the `timeit()` function used to measure time. Generally, the `time` module in the standard Python library is used to time the operations by taking the difference between the end and the start time as we saw during one of the demos on decorators. However, the way it is designed to measure time, it can be affected by other OS-related operations thus giving incorrect results. `timeit` overcomes this by running the operation a certain _number_ of times(default is 1 million, but we have used 1000 in the above example) to return the best minimum time and hence is more accurate. You can refer to [this Stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17579357/time-time-vs-timeit-timeit) to read more about the reasons why `timeit` is considered more accurate and [this tutorial](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/pythons-timeit-find-the-fastest-code-in-no-time-23d6092b5c72) for more examples on using `timeit` in different scenarios. In the above code, we are passing a callable function as the operation to the `timeit()` function which is executed 1000 times before returning the runtime."

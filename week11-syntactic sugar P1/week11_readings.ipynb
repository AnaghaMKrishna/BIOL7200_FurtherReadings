    "> Syntactic sugar is syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or to express. It makes the language \"sweeter\" for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means there are equivalent constructs that achieve the same thing but are often not used/preferred because there is a more elegant or succinct way of writing the same code. In part one of a two series readings, let us explore a few such constructs. You may be familiar with and already using these in your assignments and other coding exercises without realizing there is a more verbose way of writing them. The goal of discussing these here is two-fold:\n",
    "1. Introduce you to a few (hopefully)new syntactic sugar constructs that you can adopt.\n",
    "2. You are aware of the shorthand and their equivalent longhand notations and use them appropriately to make the code more readable. It is important to note that less verbose code is not always very readable.\n",

If we pass 0 as the argument, it returns all the subgroups, 1 returns the first subgroup and so on. We can also pass multiple arguments and the function returns those matches as tuples.\n",

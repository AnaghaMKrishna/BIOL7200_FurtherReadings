    "We have been using various types of operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `in` and so on throughout. But did you know these operators are also part of Python's syntactic sugar? If you're wondering what might be the longhand notations of these, the answer lies in the dunder methods implemented by the classes of operands. We looked at a few of these methods for comparative operators in the handouts on introduction to classes notebook, we'll look at those and a few more below:"

    "An important distinction with `iter()` is that we use `return` instead of `yield`. A consequence of this is that while it is possible to have multiple `yield` or `yield from` statements in a generator function, we cannot replace them with `return iter()` as the return statement immediately exits the function ignoring any lines that come after. \n",

    "The `with` statement is a very useful syntactic sugar for properly managing external resources such as files that our program reads from or writes to. What exactly do we mean by \"properly managing\" resources? When we open a file within the program, it is loaded into the memory. If we never close the file after working with it, it stays there occupying memory when it is no more required. This is often called a \"memory leak\". If the program deals with hundreds of files and they are never closed(or cleaned up), our system's memory is cluttered with unused resources thus leading to inefficient memory utilization. Every language has a mechanism to free unused resources and reclaim memory called garbage collection, but it is recommended that we explicitly clean these resources in the code. Quoting from the [document](https://docs.python.org/3.13/reference/datamodel.html) - \n",
    "> Some objects contain references to “external” resources such as open files or windows. It is understood that these resources are freed when the object is garbage-collected, but since garbage collection is not guaranteed to happen, such objects also provide an explicit way to release the external resource, usually a close() method. Programs are strongly recommended to explicitly close such objects. The `try…finally` statement and the `with` statement provide convenient ways to do this.\n",
